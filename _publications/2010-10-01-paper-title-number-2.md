This study evaluated computer vision-based models, including Histogram Analysis, Logistic Regression, Sift-SVM, and Deep learning models, in an autonomous testing system developed for smartphone camera modules. System performance was assessed in a practical factory setting with workers operating the system, and metrics such as processing time, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and defect rate were evaluated. Based on the results, the Sift-SVM model demonstrated the greatest potential for enhancing the reliability of the system with a processing time of 0.01578 seconds, a sensitivity of 99.811%, and a reduction in the failure rate to 1888 PPM. The study findings suggest that Sift-SVM has the potential to be practically applied in the industry, thus improving the speed and accuracy of automatic defect detection in manufacturing and reducing the defect rate.
